limitations {Disadvantages / where } python is not suitable
~ Currently python is not suitable for mobile application.There is not much penetration in mobile applications .
~ Performance wise slow {Since interpreted so one and only line is executed at a time} 
Java is better performance wise as inside JVM{Java Virtual Machine} JIT compiler
is there .But in normal version of python there is no such support is there.

Features of Python:
1.Simple and easy to learn.
2. Freeware and open source
 If we have any perforamnce issuse we can modify 
3.High level language
4.Platform independent
   Can run on any OS 
5.Portable -Suppose we already have Some piece of code{program} in windows system and we want migrate to mac
	OS
****6.Dynamically typed : 
7.Both Procedural Orientaed and object oriented
8. Interpreted : 
9. Extensible : We can use other language program in python e.g. Java or C etc can be used in python .
   We can use already existing code  and don't need to rewrite .Suppose we have code of {1Lakh LOC -Line Of
   Code} we can use it in python. By this we can improve performance of the application.
   If we bring other programming language code in our python program then we might miss the overall platform 
   Independent nature of python.
10.Embeded : we can use python program in any other language.
11. Extensive Library : we don't need to 



Flavours of Python
-------------------
1. CPython : It is the standard flavour of python it can be used to work with C language application.
2.Jython or Jpython: Works with java application .
3.IronPython : It was developed to work with C#
4.Pypy : (Python for performance) Inside the Python Virtual machine (PVM) JIT compiler is placed by default
  so the performance relatively improves.
5. RubyPython : This works with Ruby application
6.AncondaPython : To handle big data (e.g Hadoop) It was specially desiged to handdle large volume of data.
7. Stackless(Python for concurrency):Multithreaded programming. i.e. Things are going to be executed parallely.
